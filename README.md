    ~ Introduction ~
    Welcome to the Inventory Manager App!

    The app is a simple approach at a inventory application that lets you create items that you  
    save and come back to for context. Example of real-world uses include any company that
    handles inventory on a daily basis and needs to sort it through serial numbers and values.
   
    This section will help with understanding the basic functionality and utility of the app.
    Below are the various help sections with information on what to do.
    
    ~ File Menu ~
    The file menu can be accessed at the top menu bar and yields three selections:
    Open..., Save..., Close.

    Open prompts the user for input as to where their file is stored.
    Save prompts the user for input as to where they want their inventory data stored.
    Close simply exits the program. Data is not saved on close.

    Allowed file formats: .txt, .html, .json

    ~ Edit Menu ~
    The edit menu can be accessed at the top menu bar and yields two selections:
    New and Delete.
    
    New prompts the user for information on the item they want to add. 
    A monitary value, serial number, and name will be asked for. 
    Monitary values need to be exclusively numbers.
    Serial numbers have to be ten characters in length and can only inculde numbers and letters.
    Names have to be between 2 and 256 characters long.

    Error prompts will pop up if any of the above is not followed.

    Selecting Delete will prompt a message reminding the user that the delete function is behind
    right click functionality. SImply right click the item you wish to delete and select delete.
    Deletes are not saved and are final.

    The user can also edit an item directly by double clicking on the cell. 
    All previous limitations still apply to edits.

    The search bar at the bottom of the program can be used to prompt a new table with the 
    requested information.
